            # Words Must Mean Things
            _By Daniel Scheufler_
            <aside class="notes">
              As consultants, our effectiveness comes from being able to communicate and persuade others of our ideas. Very often we're pretty good at this. But have you ever encountered the use of 'done-done'? What did that actually mean? why wasn't 'done' enough? And better yet, why not use 'done done done done DONE'? After all there are more dones in there, and that has to be better right?
              This is an example of how our words can lose their meaning. Now we use new Nouns, and abbreviations all the time in our works, but where did these words get their meaning?

                  So lests start with a simple example. What is 'Take-out'?  ... And how does it comes to mean 'Chinese food to-go', 'dating', and 'assassination'?

                  Putting this in a more professional context, let's talk about done-done... We've all seen it, most of the time they seem to think it is a super-set, or somehow better than just 'done'. ... I always wonder why they don't just go all the way with 'done-done-done-done-DONE'. Obviously this is better. It's _more_ done!

                  Most often we'll see this confusion arise from our normal discussions. What should we do, how should we do it? And then suddenly the temperature in the room changes, and two heavy-weight team members are duking it out... How'd this happen? Something slipped out of context.

                  Very often when one person is talking for too long you get into this run-one sentence syndrom. for example Nabokov, The Gift: As he crossed toward the pharmacy at the corner he involuntarily turned his head because of a burst of light that had ricocheted from his temple, and saw, with that quick smile with which we greet a rainbow or a rose, a blindingly white parallelogram of sky being unloaded from the van—a dresser with mirrors across which, as across a cinema screen, passed a flawlessly clear reflection of boughs sliding and swaying not arboreally, but with a human vacillation, produced by the nature of those who were carrying this sky, these boughs, this gliding façade.

                When confronting an snr issue, increase the signal, and reduce the noice. To an extent less is more. But just like I can simplify the common typing sentence: 'the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog' to 'the fox jumped over the dog'...

                if I shorten it even furter in the 'interest of cutting out noise'. I might end up with 'fox jump dog'... and that sounds like a fox mugging the poor dog in some back alley. *sniff* the dog never knew what hit him.
