            # Words Must Mean Things
            _By Daniel Scheufler_
            <aside class="notes">
              As consultants, our effectiveness comes from being able to communicate and persuade others of our ideas. (Non-sales selling)
              Very often we're pretty good at this. But sometimes, out of the blue, we're not. It's as though our words suddenly lost their meaning.
              Taking a wider view we actually shouldn't be so suprised when this happens. It's almost built into our language (English at least).

                  So lets start with a simple example. What is 'Take-out'?  .
                  .. And how does it comes to mean 'Chinese food to-go', 'dating', and 'assassination'?
                  Thank God, the Compile keeps us from over-loading a variable name like this!

                  Putting this in a more professional context, let's talk about done-done... 
                  We've all seen it, most of the time they seem to think it is a super-set, 
                  or somehow better than just 'done'. ... 
                  I always wonder why they don't just go all the way with 'done-done-done-done-DONE'. 
                  Obviously this is better. It's _more_ done! But still feels like an overloaded variable name...

                  Most often the best warning we get that our words are losing their meaning, 
                  is an argument. We'll see this confusion arise from our normal discussions.
                  What should we do, how should we do it? And then suddenly the temperature in the room changes, 
                  and two heavy-weight team members are duking it out... How'd this happen? 
                  Something slipped out of context.

                      Those meetings can turn to uncertainty pretty quick. But where'd the meaning come from in the first place?
                      Where'd we assign that meaning to the variable identified by 'done'?

                  Y'all remember done-done? As I thought about it, I chose to file it here.
                  People coming in with different ideas of what the operational meaning of a story being 'done' is. 
                  Obviously, someone thought more steps ought to be involved, and so done-done evolved.
                  Thankfully this phrasing of the challenge also points towards a potential solutions for it.

                  Some times we are sure why this meeting is happening,

                  Honestly, it's got to be the oldest, most worn-out agenda print out ever! Cause we use it all the time and all over the place!
                  As a result we wander about in the fog, until someone gets enough influence to force a set of boundaries.

                  and at other times, the issue is that they are talking... 
                  but we aren't really sure what they are saying. 
                  Many words are coming out of their mouth 
                  but the meaning couldn't be less clear...

                  Very often when one person is talking for too long you get into this run-one sentence syndrom. 
                  The room gradually gets quieter and quieter. 
                  But if you look at the people, their expressions go from listening, 
                  to confused, to glazed over.
                  And the worst part is that the speaker can be entirely unaware. 
                  I've found this can be more likely to occur if a meeting has been 
                  held for 2 or more hours, without extended break!
