              A programming language, a new version of a language, a library or framework… a new version of it… 
                a design pattern, a refactoring technique, productivity tips and tricks and tools, a mindset, 
                a frequent challenge that you’ve find a way to address… maybe something you take for 
                granted for considering it so simple, but that you’ve made somebody very thankful for you for 
                learning it from you...

                  If I’ve faced some sort of challenge or difficult and addressed it

                [CL]My blog posts are NOT magazine articles… 
                I pick up notes I’ve taken before, timebox how much time I want to spend on it
                 (half hour, an hour), write it, post it, and move on… now I have a link I can point 
                 people to, and something for my own reference
                When I review my blog and see a pattern on the things I’ve been blogging the most about, 
                I consolidate it into a presentation.

                [CL]    
                Get practice/small runs on video… 
                leave the camera running even after you’re done with the talk. Analyze video, 
                  identify audience’s reaction, reconsider the flow… 
                look for areas where your flow may have been broken because you asked a 
                  question to the audience and things derailed… 
                consider if there are changes to the material you could make based on the 
                  questions you got from the audience.
                Always have a back up!! (my experience TechEd Europe, use timesnapper to 
                  capture your practice run to create your backup, make sure you can do your 
                  presentation completely offline… always assume there’s no internet, or bad one)

              Know: If you’ve been waking up every day for a while, you probably have something to share. 
                When you talk about it, you slow down your thoughts and see things more clearly. 
                You’re likely to help someone else when you do so.

              Feel: You can speak in public!

              Do: Find something you’re passionate about. Create a talk! Deliver it!

              We may be able to help you…
